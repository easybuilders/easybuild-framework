v1.9.0 (November 17th 2013)
---------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- add support for Tcl environment modules (modulecmd.tcl) (#728, #729, #739)
    - special care was taken to make sure also the DEISA variant of modulecmd.tcl can be used
- code refactoring to prepare for supporting two formats for easyconfig files (#693, #750)
    - this prepares the codebase for supporting easyconfig format v2.0
    - some initial work on adding support for the new easyconfig format is included, but it's by no means complete yet
    - the current easyconfig format (now dubbed v1.0) is still the default and only supported format, for now
    - for more details, see https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Easyconfig-format-two
- various other enhancements, including:
    - include a full version of vsc-base (see the 'vsc' subdirectory) (#740)
        - this is a first step towards switching to using vsc-base as a proper dependency
    - implement get_avail_core_count function in systemtools module that takes cpusets and co into account (#700)
        - the get_core_count function is now deprecated
    - add impmkl toolchain definition (#736)
    - make regtest more robust: put holds on jobs without dependencies, release holds once all jobs are submitted (#751)
    - add support for specifying multiple alternatives for sanity check paths (#753)
    - add get_software_libdir function to modules.py (along with unit tests) (#758)

v1.8.2 (October 18th 2013)
--------------------------

bugfix release
- fix regular expression used for obtaining list of modules from 'module avail' (#724)
    - modules marked as default were being hidden from EasyBuild, causing problems when they are used as dependency

v1.8.1 (October 14th 2013)
--------------------------

bugfix release
- various bug fixes, including:
    - fix bugs in regtest procedure (#713)
        - force 2nd and 3rd attempt of build in case 1st attempt failed
    - fix copying of install log to install directory (#716)
    - only create first source path if multiple paths are specified (#718)
    - detect failed PBS job submission by checking obtained job ID for None value (#713, #717, #719, #720)

v1.8.0 (October 4th 2013)
-------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- add support for using alternative module naming schemes (#679, #696, #705, #706, #707)
    - see https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Using-a-custom-module-naming-scheme for documentation
    - module naming scheme classes that derive from the 'abstract' ModuleNamingScheme class can be provided to EasyBuild
        - the Python module providing the class must be available in the easybuild.tools.module_naming_scheme namespace
        - a function named 'det_full_module_name' must be implemented, that determines the module name
          in the form of an string based on the supplied dictionary(-like) argument
    - the active module naming scheme is determined by EasyBuild configuration option 'module_naming_scheme'
    - for now, only the name/version/versionsuffix/toolchain easyconfig parameters are guaranteed to be provided
        - consistently providing all easyconfig parameters (i.e., also for dependencies) requires more work (see #687)
    - implementing this involved a number of intrusive changes:
        - the API of the modules.py module needed to be changed, breaking backward compatibility
            - the function for which the signatures were modified are considered to be internal to the framework,
              so this should have very minor impact w.r.t. easyblocks not included with EasyBuild
            - affected functions include: available, exists, show, modulefile_path, dependencies_for
        - the format for specifying dependencies was extended, to allow for specifying a custom toolchain
            - this allows to fix inaccurate dependency specifications,
              like "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2')" to "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4', '', ('GCC', '4.7.2'))"
            - see also https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/431
        - the recommended version for Lmod was bumped to v5.1.5
            - using earlier 5.x version still works, but may be very slow when 'available' is used,
              due to bugs and a missing feature in Lmod versions prior to v5.1.5 on which we rely
- various other enhancements, including:
    - only (try to) change group id if it is different from what is wanted (#685)
    - added toy build unit test (#688)
    - support for specifying a list of source paths in EasyBuild configuration (#690, #702)
    - add function to determine CPU clock speed in systemtools.py (#694, #699)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - avoid importing toolchain modules over and over again to make toolchain constants available in toolchain module (#679)
    - only change the group id if current gid is different from what we want in adjust_permissions function (#685)
    - restore original environment after running 'module purge' (#698)
        - important sidenote: this results in resetting the entire environment, and has impact on the sanity check step;
          any environment variables that are set before the EasyBlock.sanity_check_step method fires, are no longer there
          when the sanity check commands are run (cfr. https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/268)

v1.7.0 (September 2nd 2013)
