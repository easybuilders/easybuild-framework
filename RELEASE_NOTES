v1.13.0 (May 29th 2014)
-----------------------

feature + bugfix release
- make --try-X command line options work recursively (i.e. collaborate with --robot) (#922)
    - EasyBuild will first build a full dependency graph of the specified easyconfigs, and then apply the --try specifications
        - the elements of the dependency graph for the used toolchain and its dependencies are left untouched
    - this makes "eb foo-1.0-goolf-1.4.10.eb --try-toolchain=ictce,5.5.0 --robot" also work when 'foo' has dependencies
    - caveat: the specified easyconfig files must all use the same toolchain (version)
- add support for testing easyconfig pull requests from EasyBuild command line (#920, #924, #925, #932, #933, #938)
    - add --from-pr command line option for downloading easyconfig files from pull requests
    - add --upload-test-report command line option for uploading a detailed test report to GitHub as a gist
        - this requires specifying a GitHub username for which a GitHub token is available, using --github-user
        - with --dump-test-report, the test report can simply be dumped to file rather than being uploaded to GitHub
        - see also https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Review-process-for-contributions#testing-result
- the 'makeopts' and 'premakeopts' easyconfig parameter are deprecated, and replaced by 'buildopts' and 'prebuildopts' (#918)
    - both 'makeopts' and 'premakeopts' will still be honored in future EasyBuild v1.x versions, but should no longer be used
- various other enhancements, including:
    - add --disable-cleanup-builddir command line option, to keep the build dir after a (successful) build (#853)
        - the build dir is still cleaned up by default for successful builds, i.e. --cleanup-builddir is the default
    - also consider lib32 in paths checked for $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and $LIBRARY_PATH (#912)
    - reorganize support for file/git/svn repositories into 'repository' package, making it extensible (#913)
    - add support for 'postinstallcmds' easyconfig parameter, to specify commands that need to be run after the install step (#918)
    - make 'VERSION=' part in version of C environment modules tool optional, which is required for older versions (#930)

        - fancylogger (used for logging in EasyBuild) is now robust against strings containing UTF8 characters
        - the 'deprecated' logging function now does a non-strict version check (rather than an erroneous strict check)
        - the easybuild.tools.agithub module is removed, vsc.utils.rest now provides the required functionality
    - fix support for unpacking gzipped source files, don't unpack .gz files in-place in the source directory (#936)

    - special care was taken to make sure also the DEISA variant of modulecmd.tcl can be used
- code refactoring to prepare for supporting two formats for easyconfig files (#693, #750)
    - this prepares the codebase for supporting easyconfig format v2.0
    - some initial work on adding support for the new easyconfig format is included, but it's by no means complete yet
    - the current easyconfig format (now dubbed v1.0) is still the default and only supported format, for now
    - for more details, see https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Easyconfig-format-two
- various other enhancements, including:

v1.8.0 (October 4th 2013)
-------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- add support for using alternative module naming schemes (#679, #696, #705, #706, #707)
    - see https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Using-a-custom-module-naming-scheme for documentation
    - module naming scheme classes that derive from the 'abstract' ModuleNamingScheme class can be provided to EasyBuild
        - the Python module providing the class must be available in the easybuild.tools.module_naming_scheme namespace
        - a function named 'det_full_module_name' must be implemented, that determines the module name
          in the form of an string based on the supplied dictionary(-like) argument
    - the active module naming scheme is determined by EasyBuild configuration option 'module_naming_scheme'
    - for now, only the name/version/versionsuffix/toolchain easyconfig parameters are guaranteed to be provided
        - consistently providing all easyconfig parameters (i.e., also for dependencies) requires more work (see #687)
    - implementing this involved a number of intrusive changes:
        - the API of the modules.py module needed to be changed, breaking backward compatibility
            - the function for which the signatures were modified are considered to be internal to the framework,
              so this should have very minor impact w.r.t. easyblocks not included with EasyBuild
            - affected functions include: available, exists, show, modulefile_path, dependencies_for
        - the format for specifying dependencies was extended, to allow for specifying a custom toolchain
            - this allows to fix inaccurate dependency specifications,
              like "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2')" to "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4', '', ('GCC', '4.7.2'))"
            - see also https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/431
        - the recommended version for Lmod was bumped to v5.1.5
            - using earlier 5.x version still works, but may be very slow when 'available' is used,
              due to bugs and a missing feature in Lmod versions prior to v5.1.5 on which we rely
- various other enhancements, including:
    - only (try to) change group id if it is different from what is wanted (#685)
    - added toy build unit test (#688)
    - support for specifying a list of source paths in EasyBuild configuration (#690, #702)
    - add function to determine CPU clock speed in systemtools.py (#694, #699)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - avoid importing toolchain modules over and over again to make toolchain constants available in toolchain module (#679)
    - only change the group id if current gid is different from what we want in adjust_permissions function (#685)
    - restore original environment after running 'module purge' (#698)
        - important sidenote: this results in resetting the entire environment, and has impact on the sanity check step;
          any environment variables that are set before the EasyBlock.sanity_check_step method fires, are no longer there
          when the sanity check commands are run (cfr. https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/268)

    - report reason for failed sanity check for extensions (#672, #678)
    - fix --list-toolchains command line option (#675)

    - define ExtensionEasyblock class that implements support for installing extensions as stand-alone module as well
    - return to build dir before building/installing each extension
    - define EBEXTSLIST<NAME> environment variable in module if exts_list was defined
    - make sure sanity check for extensions results in an error if it fails
- various enhancements, including:
    - log both framework and easyblocks versions

    - support both setuptools and distutils installation methods for finding installed easyconfigs
    - also consider robot path in list of paths searched for patch files
    - allow skipping of default extension sanity check (by setting 'modulename' to False in options)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - typos in toolchain Python modules w.r.t. imkl support, handling of i8/optarch/unroll options
    - purge before loading 'fake' module, unload 'fake' module before removing it, use original MODULEPATH
    - restore environment after unloading fake module, set variables that were incorrectly unset, i.e., that were defined before as well
    - unset TMPDIR for builds submitted as jobs (required by IntelBase easyblock)
    - correctly track easyconfig parse error
    - always run all jobs in regtest, also if dependency jobs failed
    - cosmetic adjustments to default EasyBuild configuration file to avoid confusion between e.g. build_dir and build_path (only latter matters)
    - fix SuSe hack, only prefix command with sourcing of /etc/profile.d/modules.sh if it is there
    - leave build directory before it is removed during cleanup step
    - load generated module file before running test cases

v1.0.2 (December 8th 2012)
--------------------------

bugfix release
- properly catch failing sanity check commands
- fix bug in toolchain support which cause linking environment variables set by toolchain to include too many libraries
    - elements in toolchain variables were being passed by reference instead of by value
- fix selecting a compiler toolchain for a specified software package (--software-name) if only a template is a viable option
- fix passing command line parameters with --job
- fix list of valid stops (-s/--stop)
- fix minor issues in help messages (-h/--help)

v1.0.1 (November 24th 2012)
---------------------------

bugfix release
- fix support for installing easybuild-framework with distutils (broken import in setup.py)
- fix support for ACML as a toolchain element (toolchains/linalg/acml.py)
- add name to aggregated regtest XML so that is parsed correctly by Jenkins
- reorder code in main.py so that regtest also works with incomplete easyconfig paths
- add bash script for running regression test and sending a trigger to Jenkins to pull in the XML with results
- get rid of assumption that loaded modules should have name like 'foo/bar', make it more flexible
- retry failed builds in regtest twice to ignore fluke errors
- report leaf nodes in dependency graph when regtest is submitted
    - this is required for setting job dependencies in the regtest script for the Jenkins trigger job
- implement and use rmtree2 as more (NFS) robust replacement for shutil.rmtree
- bump max hit count for run_cmd_qa from 20 to 50, to make false positives of unasnwered questions less likely
