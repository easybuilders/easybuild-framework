--------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- improvements w.r.t. support for software extensions (tested on Python and R, see easyblocks package)
    - cleaned up support for building/installing extensions
    - define ExtensionEasyblock class that implements support for installing extensions as stand-alone module as well
    - return to build dir before building/installing each extension
    - define EBEXTSLIST<NAME> environment variable in module if exts_list was defined
    - make sure sanity check for extensions results in an error if it fails

    - support both setuptools and distutils installation methods for finding installed easyconfigs
    - also consider robot path in list of paths searched for patch files
    - allow skipping of default extension sanity check (by setting 'modulename' to False in options)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - typos in toolchain Python modules w.r.t. imkl support, handling of i8/optarch/unroll options
    - purge before loading 'fake' module, unload 'fake' module before removing it, use original MODULEPATH
    - restore environment after unloading fake module, set variables that were incorrectly unset, i.e., that were defined before as well
    - unset TMPDIR for builds submitted as jobs (required by IntelBase easyblock)
    - correctly track easyconfig parse error
    - always run all jobs in regtest, also if dependency jobs failed
    - cosmetic adjustments to default EasyBuild configuration file to avoid confusion between e.g. build_dir and build_path (only latter matters)
    - fix SuSe hack, only prefix command with sourcing of /etc/profile.d/modules.sh if it is there
    - leave build directory before it is removed during cleanup step
    - load generated module file before running test cases

v1.0.2 (December 8th 2012)
--------------------------

bugfix release
- properly catch failing sanity check commands
- fix bug in toolchain support which cause linking environment variables set by toolchain to include too many libraries
    - elements in toolchain variables were being passed by reference instead of by value
- fix selecting a compiler toolchain for a specified software package (--software-name) if only a template is a viable option
- fix passing command line parameters with --job
- fix list of valid stops (-s/--stop)
- fix minor issues in help messages (-h/--help)

v1.0.1 (November 24th 2012)
---------------------------

bugfix release
- fix support for installing easybuild-framework with distutils (broken import in setup.py)
- fix support for ACML as a toolchain element (toolchains/linalg/acml.py)
- add name to aggregated regtest XML so that is parsed correctly by Jenkins
- reorder code in main.py so that regtest also works with incomplete easyconfig paths
- add bash script for running regression test and sending a trigger to Jenkins to pull in the XML with results
- get rid of assumption that loaded modules should have name like 'foo/bar', make it more flexible
- retry failed builds in regtest twice to ignore fluke errors
- report leaf nodes in dependency graph when regtest is submitted
    - this is required for setting job dependencies in the regtest script for the Jenkins trigger job
- implement and use rmtree2 as more (NFS) robust replacement for shutil.rmtree
- bump max hit count for run_cmd_qa from 20 to 50, to make false positives of unasnwered questions less likely
