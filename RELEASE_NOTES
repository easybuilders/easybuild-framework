feature + bugfix release
- make --try-X command line options work recursively (i.e. collaborate with --robot) (#922)
    - EasyBuild will first build a full dependency graph of the specified easyconfigs, and then apply the --try specifications
        - the elements of the dependency graph for the used toolchain and its dependencies are left untouched
    - this makes "eb foo-1.0-goolf-1.4.10.eb --try-toolchain=ictce,5.5.0 --robot" also work when 'foo' has dependencies
    - caveat: the specified easyconfig files must all use the same toolchain (version)

    - add --from-pr command line option for downloading easyconfig files from pull requests
    - add --upload-test-report command line option for uploading a detailed test report to GitHub as a gist
        - this requires specifying a GitHub username for which a GitHub token is available, using --github-user
        - with --dump-test-report, the test report can simply be dumped to file rather than being uploaded to GitHub
        - see also https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Integration_with_GitHub.html#uploading-test-reports-upload-test-report
- the 'makeopts' and 'premakeopts' easyconfig parameter are deprecated, and replaced by 'buildopts' and 'prebuildopts' (#918)
    - both 'makeopts' and 'premakeopts' will still be honored in future EasyBuild v1.x versions, but should no longer be used
- various other enhancements, including:
    - add --disable-cleanup-builddir command line option, to keep the build dir after a (successful) build (#853)
        - the build dir is still cleaned up by default for successful builds, i.e. --cleanup-builddir is the default
    - also consider lib32 in paths checked for $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and $LIBRARY_PATH (#912)

    - this prepares the codebase for supporting easyconfig format v2.0
    - some initial work on adding support for the new easyconfig format is included, but it's by no means complete yet
    - the current easyconfig format (now dubbed v1.0) is still the default and only supported format, for now

v1.8.0 (October 4th 2013)
-------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- add support for using alternative module naming schemes (#679, #696, #705, #706, #707)
    - see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/Using-a-custom-module-naming-scheme for documentation
    - module naming scheme classes that derive from the 'abstract' ModuleNamingScheme class can be provided to EasyBuild
        - the Python module providing the class must be available in the easybuild.tools.module_naming_scheme namespace
        - a function named 'det_full_module_name' must be implemented, that determines the module name
          in the form of an string based on the supplied dictionary(-like) argument
    - the active module naming scheme is determined by EasyBuild configuration option 'module_naming_scheme'
    - for now, only the name/version/versionsuffix/toolchain easyconfig parameters are guaranteed to be provided
        - consistently providing all easyconfig parameters (i.e., also for dependencies) requires more work (see #687)
    - implementing this involved a number of intrusive changes:
        - the API of the modules.py module needed to be changed, breaking backward compatibility
            - the function for which the signatures were modified are considered to be internal to the framework,
              so this should have very minor impact w.r.t. easyblocks not included with EasyBuild
            - affected functions include: available, exists, show, modulefile_path, dependencies_for
        - the format for specifying dependencies was extended, to allow for specifying a custom toolchain
            - this allows to fix inaccurate dependency specifications,
              like "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2')" to "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4', '', ('GCC', '4.7.2'))"
            - see also https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/431
        - the recommended version for Lmod was bumped to v5.1.5
            - using earlier 5.x version still works, but may be very slow when 'available' is used,
              due to bugs and a missing feature in Lmod versions prior to v5.1.5 on which we rely
- various other enhancements, including:
    - only (try to) change group id if it is different from what is wanted (#685)
    - added toy build unit test (#688)
    - support for specifying a list of source paths in EasyBuild configuration (#690, #702)
    - add function to determine CPU clock speed in systemtools.py (#694, #699)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - avoid importing toolchain modules over and over again to make toolchain constants available in toolchain module (#679)
    - only change the group id if current gid is different from what we want in adjust_permissions function (#685)
    - restore original environment after running 'module purge' (#698)
        - important sidenote: this results in resetting the entire environment, and has impact on the sanity check step;
          any environment variables that are set before the EasyBlock.sanity_check_step method fires, are no longer there
          when the sanity check commands are run (cfr. https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/268)

- split up EasyBuild across three repositories: framework, easyblocks and easyconfigs
- packaged EasyBuild, different parts can now be installed easily using easy_install
- various changes to both internal and external API:
    - renamed main script to main.py (from build.py)
    - file and directory organisation
    - module, class, function and function argument renaming and reorganisation
    - split up Application into EasyBlock and ConfigureMake (see easybuild-easyblocks for the latter)
    - created EasyConfig class for handling easyconfig files
    - renaming of EasyBuild configuration parameters (non-camelCase)
    - renaming of various easyconfig parameters (non-camelCase)
    - rename SOFTROOT and SOFTVERSION environment variables set in generated module files to EBROOT and EBVERSION
    - use 'extension' as generic terminology for Python packages, R libraries, Perl modules, ...
- added support for building software packages in parallel via PBS jobs
- added unit testing framework and initial set of unit tests for basic functionality
    - and run them in Jenkins continuous integration service, see https://jenkins1.ugent.be/view/EasyBuild/
- implement single-command regression test (e.g. to test building all supported software)
    - eb --regtest --robot
- switch to new style Python classes
- replaced toolkit module with toolchain package (total rewrite), providing modular support for toolchains
- adjust default EasyBuild configuration to only use $HOME/.local/easybuild by default
- added support for running EasyBuild without supplying an easyconfig file
    - make EasyBuild search for a matching easyconfig file
    - support automatic rewriting of an existing partially-matching easyconfig file (use this with care!)
    - support for automatically generating an easyconfig file according to given specifications (best effort!)
- add support for looking for easyconfig file in Python search path if it can't be found on specified (relative) path
    (that way, easyconfig files available in the easybuild-easyconfigs package can be used easily)
- various other enhancements and bug fixes, e.g.:
    - extended sanity check capabilities
    - cleaned up logging
    - creating of devel module which allows to mimic environment that was used by EasyBuild to build the software
    - support for creating dependency graphs for a set of easyconfig files
    - grouped options in help output and categorised available easyconfig parameters
    - more consistent code style

v0.8 (June 29th 2012)
---------------------

- added support for building/installing 17 additional software packages:
    - BEAGLE, Doxygen, g2clib, g2lib, HDF, HDF5, JasPer, libpng, Maple,
      MrBayes, NCL, netCDF, netCDF-Fortran, Szip, WPS, WRF, zlib
- the build procedure for WRF and WPS includes running the tests available for these packages
- various bug fixes and enhancements:
    - made support for interactive installers (run_cmd_qa) more robust
    - fixed Python git package check
    - implemented toolkit functions for determine compiler family, MPI type, MPI run command, ...

v0.7 (June 18th 2012)
---------------------

- fixed BLACS build
    - diagnostic tools to determine INTERFACE and TRANSCOMM values are now used
- added support for building Bison, CP2K, flex
    - with regression test enabled for CP2K as part of build process
    - note: BLACS built with EasyBuild prior to v0.7 needs to be rebuilt for CP2K to work correctly
- added --enable-mpi-threads to OpenMPI example easyconfigs
    - required for correct CP2K psmp build
- adjusted libsmm example easyconfig for lower build time
    - to make the full regression test finish in a reasonable amount of time
- added script to make porting of easyblocks from old to new EasyBuild codebase easier
    - takes care of refactoring, checks for PyLint warnings/errors, ...
- fixed several small bugs
- prefixed EasyBuild messages with "=="
- full regression test passed (58 easyconfigs tested)

v0.6 (May 11th 2012)
---------------------

- added support for Intel compiler toolkit (ictce)
    - which included the Intel compilers, Intel Math Kernel Library (imkl) and Intel MPI library (impi)
- added support for building Python with nose/numpy/scipy packages
- added simple regression test
- this version is able to build all supplied example easyconfigs

v0.5 (April 6th 2012)
----------------------

- first public release of EasyBuild
    - after a thorough cleanup of the EasyBuild framework of the in-house version
- supports building HPL with goalf compiler toolkit
    - the goalf toolkit consists of the GCC compilers, and the OpenMPI, ATLAS, LAPACK, FFTW and ScaLAPACK libraries
- also support build and installation of MVAPICH2
