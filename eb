# EasyBuild main script
# find location of main EasyBuild script by looking in Python search path, and run it

#  this is an alternative for "python -m easybuild.main $@" which has issues, i.e.
#  * it doesn't work with Python 2.4 (which we hang on to because of it being the default version in RedHat v5)
#  * an ugly warning is printed whenever the pkg_resources module is loaded (e.g. by 3rd party modules like pygraph),
#    see http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue36
#    the cause of this is probably that we spread out the easybuild namespace across different locations
