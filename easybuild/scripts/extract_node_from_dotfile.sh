# Use case:
#
# A large dotfile that contains all software installed with EasyBuild can be generated with a command line such as:
#   eb --dep-graph=depgraph.dot $EASYBUILD_INSTALLPATH/software/*/*/easybuild/*.eb
# Such a dotfile is (typically) too large to deal with directly. This script can extract a particular node from such a
# dotfile, e.g.,
#   ./<script> <input dot file> <output dot file> "Compiler/GCCcore/7.3.0/h5py/2.8.0-serial-Python-3.6.6"
# which can be used to help evaluate the impact of uninstalling that particular software package
