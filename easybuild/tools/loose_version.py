# This file contains the LooseVersion class based on the class with the same name
# as present in Python 3.7.4 distutils.
# The original class is licensed under the Python Software Foundation License Version 2.
# It was slightly simplified as needed to make it shorter and easier to read.
# In particular the following changes were made:
# - Subclass object directly instead of abstract Version class
# - Fully init the class in the constructor removing the parse method
# - Always set self.vstring and self.version
# - Shorten the comparison operators as the NotImplemented case doesn't apply anymore
# - Changes to documentation and formatting
