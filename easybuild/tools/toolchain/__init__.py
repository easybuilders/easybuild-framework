Toolchain terminology
---------------------

Toolchain: group of development related utilities (eg compiler) and libraries (eg MPI, linear algebra)
    -> eg tc=Toolchain()


Toolchain options : options passed to the toolchain through the easyconfig file
    -> eg tc.options

Options : all options passed to an executable
    Flags: specific subset of options, typically involved with compilation
        -> eg tc.variables.CFLAGS
    LinkOptions: specific subset of options, typically involved with linking
        -> eg tc.variables.LIBBLAS

TooclchainVariables: list of environment variables that are set when the toolchain is initialised
           and the toolchain options have been parsed.
    -> eg tc.variables['X'] will be available as os.environ['X']


This module initializes the tools.toolchain package of EasyBuild,
which contains toolchain related modules.
